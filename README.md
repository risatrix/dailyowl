# Your Daily Owl
Creates a *sortes vergilianae*, but with owls

## In More Detail
This bot visits the [Aeneid API's *sortes*](http://api.aeneid.eu/sortes) address to find a prophetic saying. Then it uses NLP to find the first noun in the 
phrase and replaces it with the word 'owl', because I think it's funny. Eventually it will tweet this stuff.

## What the heck is a sortes?
The Sortes Virgilianae were a way of telling fortunes or answering questions, and if you don't believe me you can check that 
arbiter of truth, [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sortes_Vergilianae). The Romans also practiced [augury by
birdwatching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augury), so I thought the owl was in keeping with the general theme, as being entertaining.

Like a like of prophetic devices, *sortes* relied very much on interpretation.
